<img align="right" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="margin-left: 15px;">My name is Brian Williams and I'm a security engineer working for <a href="https://www.whitehatsec.com/" target="_blank">Whitehat Security</a> in Houston, Texas. I decided to create this blog because I love learning new things about technology and sharing my discoveries. I'll be writing about anything I find cool, interesting, or educative. I hope you enjoy reading. Cheers!
